## Basic todo app built with dox - using state management and dox map() function!

### Installation
 - fork or download and run in your browser!


### Notice 
- this uses tailwind play version - it is truly slow and causes render blocks it is only used for styling thus would recommend just locally styling in css! - if u do not believe me just remove the tailwind tag and see how fast it is :}
